 * The launcher screen, which exists to do one thing: get the overlay permission
 * and start the bubble.
 *
 * Deliberately not a wrapper around the website. brawlzone.net is a good site in
 * a browser and re-hosting it in a WebView would add nothing except a worse back
 * button — the only thing a native app can do that the web cannot is draw over
 * another app, so that is all this does.
 *
 * The screen itself is `activity_main.xml`. It used to be assembled here in
 * Kotlin, which is how it ended up passing raw pixels to `setPadding`: the
 * margins were a third of their intended size on any modern display.

     * Stop control lives.

     * the app is in the foreground with the reader's attention, and a
     * permission prompt appearing over a game is the thing this app has spent
     * several releases learning not to do.
